## Goal 
* There are some really great code ecosystems that are being built.
* There are a few {engineers, patterns, systems} that are critical to these ecosystems.
* There is too much volume to keep a track of.
* Hence, it'll be good to have a tool that can help monitor this.

## Ideal functionality
* Get statistics on repos via command line. Something like: `make <repo-name(s)>`
* I'm assuming some of the repos are private, hence, we might want to dump statistics in an `/output` folder and not commit stuff that's private.
* Should be easily extended to add new reports/metrics/outputs


## Some usefull links
* [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/): A code search tool. Mainly centered around finding code not so much so the commiters. 
* [pydriller](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html): A good python library that we can build on/extend.
